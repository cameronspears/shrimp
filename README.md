## Why Shrimp Health?

Shrimp Health is your **quality copilot** - an MCP server specifically designed for Claude Code users building Next.js 15+ applications. Unlike general linters, Shrimp focuses on App Router best practices, WCAG 2.0 compliance, and keeping your codebase clean:

- **Next.js 15+ Focused**: Deep understanding of App Router, Server Components, and Vercel patterns
- **WCAG 2.0 Compliance**: Automated accessibility checks for your UI components
- **Production-Ready**: 406 tests with 84.56% coverage ensure reliability
- **Fast**: 19ms average per file - analyze your entire codebase in seconds
- **MCP Native**: Works seamlessly inside Claude Code conversations
- **Battle-Tested**: Validated on real Next.js projects and self-dogfooded

**Not a replacement for ESLint** - Shrimp complements your linter by focusing on Next.js patterns, accessibility, and best practices that traditional linters miss.

## Installation

```bash
# Global installation (recommended)
npm install -g shrimp-health

# Or use with npx (no installation)
npx shrimp-health check

# Project installation
npm install --save-dev shrimp-health
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run health check
shrimp check

# Auto-fix simple issues
shrimp fix

# Invoke Claude for complex fixes (requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
shrimp fix --claude

# Run in CI/CD
shrimp check --threshold 80 --json

# View usage statistics
shrimp status
```

## Usage

### Basic Health Check

```bash
shrimp check
```

Output:
```
Shrimp Codebase Health Check v4.0
[OK] Health Check completed in 87ms - Score: 92/100

Recommendations:
  - Fix 2 critical bug(s)
  - Remove 5 unused import(s)
  - Address 3 Next.js warning(s)
```

### Auto-Fix

```bash
# Fix simple issues automatically
shrimp fix

# Use Claude to fix complex issues (requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
shrimp fix --claude
```

### Git Hook Integration

```bash
# Install git hooks
shrimp install-hooks

# Uninstall
shrimp uninstall-hooks
```

Add to `.husky/pre-commit`:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
shrimp check --threshold 85 || exit 1
```

### CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Health Check
  run: |
    npm install -g shrimp-health
    shrimp check --threshold 80 --json > health-report.json
```

## Configuration

Create `.shrimprc.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "checks": {
    "bugs": true,
    "performance": true,
    "imports": true,
    "consistency": true,
    "wcag": true,
    "nextjs": true
  },
  "ignore": [
    "node_modules",
    "dist",
    ".next",
    "*.test.ts"
  ],
  "thresholds": {
    "minimum": 80,
    "target": 95
  },
  "autofix": {
    "enabled": true,
    "claude": false
  }
}
```

## Claude Integration

Shrimp can automatically invoke Claude to fix complex issues:

```bash
# Enable Claude auto-fix (requires API key)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
shrimp fix --claude
```

Claude will:
1. Read your codebase context
2. Understand the detected issues
3. Apply fixes while maintaining your code style
4. Run verification checks

### Claude Code (MCP) Integration

Use Shrimp directly inside Claude Code conversations!

Shrimp includes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that lets Claude Code run health checks and apply fixes automatically during your conversations.

**Quick Setup:**

```bash
# Build the MCP server
cd mcp-server
bun install && bun run build

# Add to Claude Code config (~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shrimp-health": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/full/path/to/shrimp-health/mcp-server/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Then restart Claude Code and try:**

> "Run a health check on this project"

Claude Code will automatically use Shrimp's tools! See [mcp-server/SETUP.md](mcp-server/SETUP.md) for full instructions.

**Available MCP Tools:**
- `shrimp_check` - Run health checks with threshold enforcement
- `shrimp_fix` - Auto-fix issues (with dry-run support)
- `shrimp_status` - Get quick status with detailed breakdown
- `shrimp_explain` - Explain issue types with examples
- `shrimp_watch_start` - Start real-time file watching
- `shrimp_watch_stop` - Stop file watching and get statistics
- `shrimp_get_live_status` - Get cached watcher status (fast, no re-scan)
- `shrimp_precommit` - Pre-commit checks for git hooks (NEW!)

## Health Score

Your health score (0-100) is calculated from:
- Bug severity and count (30%)
- Performance issues (25%)
- Code consistency (20%)
- Import cleanliness (10%)
- Accessibility (10%)
- Framework best practices (5%)

Points are deducted based on issue severity:
- Critical bugs: -5pts each (capped at 20pts)
- Performance issues: -4pts each (capped at 15pts)
- Next.js violations: -3pts each (capped at 15pts)
- Consistency issues: -1pt per 3 issues (capped at 10pts)
- Import issues: -0.5pts each (capped at 10pts)

## Validation & Performance

Shrimp Health has been validated against 5 real Next.js projects to ensure high precision and low false positive rates.

### Tested Projects

- **tailwind-blog** - Content-focused blog
- **leerob.io** - Highly polished personal site (94.8/100 health score)
- **blog-starter** - Official Next.js example

### Results
- **406 Tests** - 84.56% coverage for reliability
- **19ms Average** - Per file analysis time
- **Self-Dogfooded** - Shrimp runs on itself (95.8/100 health score)
- **Real Projects** - Validated on production Next.js codebases

### Performance Benchmarks

import { ShrimpHealth } from 'shrimp-health';

const shrimp = new ShrimpHealth({
  sourceRoot: './src',
  config: { /* ... */ }
});

const result = await shrimp.check();
console.log(`Health Score: ${result.healthScore}/100`);
console.log(`Issues: ${result.totalIssues}`);
```
