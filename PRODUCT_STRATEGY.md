# Shrimp Product Strategy: The Claude Code Health Guardian

## Vision Statement
**"The invisible health guardian that makes Claude Code users more productive by safely auto-fixing code health issues on every commit."**

## Core Thesis
Claude Code users are making rapid changes to their codebases. They need a tool that:
1. Catches quality regressions BEFORE they accumulate
2. Fixes safe issues automatically without interrupting flow
3. Surfaces critical issues that need human attention
4. Builds trust through conservative, safe fixes
5. Becomes invisible infrastructure they don't think about

## The "Can't Live Without It" Formula

### Phase 1: Deep Claude Code Integration (Weeks 1-3)
**Goal:** Make Shrimp feel native to Claude Code

#### 1.1 MCP Server Integration
- **Create Shrimp MCP server** that exposes:
  - `shrimp_check`: Run health check on current directory
  - `shrimp_fix`: Auto-fix safe issues
  - `shrimp_explain`: Explain a specific health issue
  - `shrimp_status`: Get current health score and trends

- **Why this matters:** Claude Code can proactively run Shrimp checks and suggest fixes during conversations
- **Monetization hook:** MCP features are Pro-tier only after 50 calls/month

#### 1.2 Git Hook Installation (Zero-Config)
```bash
shrimp install --auto
```
- Auto-detects if in Claude Code project (checks for `.claude/` directory)
- Installs pre-commit hook that:
  - Runs health check (< 100ms target)
  - Auto-fixes safe issues (imports, formatting, obvious bugs)
  - Shows health score diff
  - Blocks commit if score drops below threshold (configurable)

- **Default behavior:** Fix on commit, warn on regressions, never block unless critical
- **Trust-building:** Shows exactly what was fixed in commit message

#### 1.3 Claude Code Slash Command
Create `.claude/commands/shrimp.md`:
```markdown
Run Shrimp health check on the codebase and fix any safe issues.
Then explain what was found and fixed in a clear summary.
```

### Phase 2: Safe Auto-Fixing That Builds Trust (Weeks 2-4)
**Goal:** Users trust Shrimp to fix things without review

#### 2.1 Conservative Fix Categories
**Tier 1 - Always Safe (auto-fix without asking):**
- Unused imports
- Console.log statements (except in specific files)
- Obvious typos in comments
- Whitespace/formatting issues
- Missing semicolons (if project uses them)
- Empty catch blocks → add comment

**Tier 2 - Safe with Context (auto-fix with notification):**
- Missing alt text → infer from context
- Missing aria-labels → generate from nearby text
- Basic performance issues (inline objects in render)
- Outdated patterns with clear modern equivalents

**Tier 3 - Needs Review (flag but don't fix):**
- Complex refactorings
- Architectural changes
- Anything that changes logic
- Performance issues requiring architectural changes

#### 2.2 Safety Mechanisms
- **Rollback support:** Every fix creates a git stash
- **Dry-run first:** Show what would be fixed before applying
- **Commit hooks:** User can always `SHRIMP_SKIP=1 git commit` to bypass
- **Health score must improve:** Never apply a fix that lowers health score

#### 2.3 Trust-Building Features
- **Fix changelog:** Every commit shows what Shrimp fixed
- **Undo command:** `shrimp undo` reverts last auto-fix
- **Learn mode:** First week shows what would be fixed, doesn't apply
- **Confidence scores:** Each fix shows confidence level (95% = safe)

### Phase 3: The Indispensable Features (Weeks 4-8)
**Goal:** Create features users can't imagine living without

#### 3.1 Health Trends Dashboard
- **Local dashboard:** `shrimp dashboard` opens beautiful terminal UI
- Shows:
  - Health score over time (last 30 days)
  - Most common issues fixed
  - Time saved (estimated)
  - Commit health correlation (do commits improve or hurt health?)

#### 3.2 Claude Code Proactive Suggestions
When Claude Code is making changes, Shrimp MCP server can:
- Alert Claude if changes will hurt health score
- Suggest fixes before committing
- Show health impact of proposed changes
- "This change will drop health from 92 → 87. Want me to fix X first?"

#### 3.3 Pre-Commit Health Diff
```
Shrimp Health Check
  Before: 89/100
  After:  91/100 (+2)

  Auto-fixed:
    + Removed 3 unused imports
    + Fixed 2 accessibility issues
    + Optimized 1 performance issue

  New issues found:
    ! Large function in src/utils.ts:45 (complexity: 15)
```

#### 3.4 CI/CD Integration That Actually Works
- **GitHub Action:** One-line setup
- **Quality Gates:** Fail PR if health drops > 5 points
- **Automatic fixes in PRs:** Shrimp bot comments with fixes
- **Health badges:** Show health score in README

4. **Freemium conversion:**
   - After 50 free checks: "You've saved 2.5 hours with Shrimp! Upgrade for unlimited checks."
   - Trial ends with summary: "Last month Shrimp fixed 127 issues automatically. Keep it going?"
   - Social proof: "Join 1,000+ developers keeping their codebase healthy"

#### 4.3 Revenue Projections

**Conservative (Year 1):**
- Month 3: 100 users (10 paid) = $50 MRR
- Month 6: 500 users (50 paid) = $250 MRR
- Month 9: 2,000 users (200 paid) = $1,000 MRR
- Month 12: 5,000 users (500 paid) = $2,500 MRR

**Optimistic (Year 1):**
- Month 3: 500 users (50 paid) = $250 MRR
- Month 6: 2,000 users (200 paid) = $1,000 MRR
- Month 9: 5,000 users (600 paid) = $3,000 MRR
- Month 12: 10,000 users (1,200 paid) = $6,000 MRR

**Key assumption:** 10% free-to-paid conversion (industry standard for dev tools)

### Phase 5: The "Wow" Moment Features
**Goal:** Create viral "I can't believe this is possible" moments

#### 5.1 AI Fix Explanations
After auto-fixing, show:
```
Shrimp fixed 5 issues:

1. Removed unused import 'useState'
   Why: Not referenced anywhere in this file
   Impact: Cleaner code, smaller bundle
   Confidence: 99%

2. Added alt text to <img> on line 47
   Generated: "User profile avatar"
   Why: Improves accessibility (WCAG 2.1)
   Confidence: 85%
```

#### 5.2 Health Score Predictions
"Based on your commit patterns, your health score will be 75/100 in 30 days if current trends continue. Want help improving it?"

#### 5.3 Codebase Health Report (Weekly Digest)
Email/Slack summary:
```
Your codebase this week:

  Health: 89/100 (↑3 from last week)

  Shrimp auto-fixed:
    - 23 import issues
    - 8 accessibility issues
    - 12 performance warnings

  Time saved: ~2.5 hours

  Top recommendations:
    1. Refactor src/utils/large-file.ts (650 lines)
    2. Add tests for 5 new functions
    3. Update 3 outdated dependencies
```

#### 5.4 Claude Code Collaboration Mode
When Claude Code is actively editing:
- Real-time health score in status bar
- Inline suggestions as Claude types
- "Claude is making changes... health 87→89 ✓"
- Automatic cleanup after Claude sessions

## Competitive Positioning

**vs ESLint/Prettier:** "We fix what linters miss - and integrate with your AI workflow"

**vs SonarQube:** "Lightweight, instant, and actually auto-fixes issues"

**vs GitHub Copilot:** "We're the quality guardian for AI-generated code"

**vs Nothing:** "AI writes code fast - Shrimp keeps it clean"

## The Pitch (30 seconds)

"Shrimp is the health guardian for codebases built with Claude Code. It runs on every commit, automatically fixes quality issues, and keeps your codebase clean while you move fast. It's like having a senior developer doing code review in real-time - but it actually fixes things instead of just commenting. $5/month, saves hours per week."

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk:** Auto-fixes break things
**Mitigation:** Conservative tier system, rollback support, high confidence threshold

**Risk:** Claude Code users don't care about code health
**Mitigation:** Focus on time savings and productivity, not just "clean code"

**Risk:** Too expensive for individual developers
**Mitigation:** Strong free tier, annual pricing option, show clear ROI

**Risk:** Can't compete with free linters
**Mitigation:** Position as complementary, focus on auto-fixing and AI integration

**Risk:** Low conversion rate
**Mitigation:** Make free tier valuable, clear upgrade prompts, social proof

## The "Can't Live Without It" Test

After 30 days, users should say:
- ✓ "I don't even think about code health anymore"
- ✓ "My commits are automatically cleaner"
- ✓ "Claude Code + Shrimp is my setup now"
- ✓ "I recommended it to my whole team"
- ✓ "It's paid for itself 10x over"

If they're saying these things, we've succeeded.

---

**Bottom line:** Make Shrimp the invisible infrastructure that Claude Code users rely on without thinking about it. Like spell-check for writing - you don't think about it, but you'd absolutely notice if it was gone.
