## Detector Performance

### 1. Bug Detector

**Issues Detected:** 1,846 across all projects
**Precision:** 35% (643 actionable / 1,846 total)

**Detection Categories:**

| Category | Count | Precision | Status |
|----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Type Safety Issues | 50 | 90% | High value |
| Resource Leaks | 10 | 100% | Critical findings |
| Error Handling | 400 | 30% | Mixed results |
| Dead Code Detection | 1,200+ | 20% | High noise |
| Code Complexity | 180 | 40% | Informational |

**Strengths:**
- Excellent detection of type safety issues (non-null assertions, `any` usage)
- 100% accuracy on resource leaks (addEventListener without cleanup)
- Catches missing error handling in data fetching functions

**Known Limitations:**
- Framework-specific exports (Next.js `metadata`, `generateStaticParams`) sometimes flagged as unused
- Async page components flagged for missing try-catch (Next.js error boundaries handle these)
- Library APIs with exported but internally-unused functions generate false positives

---

### 2. Performance Detector

**Issues Detected:** 897 across all projects
**Precision:** 42% (377 actionable / 897 total)

**Detection Categories:**

| Category | Count | Precision | Status |
|----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Synchronous File Operations | 5 | 100% | Critical |
| Missing Memoization | 70 | 70% | Valuable |
| React Performance | 620 | 50% | Mixed |
| Inline Objects in Loops | 200 | 20% | Low signal |

**Strengths:**
- 100% accuracy detecting blocking file operations (`readFileSync()` in API routes)
- Identifies legitimate missing `useMemo`/`useCallback` opportunities
- Catches expensive array operations in render without memoization

**Known Limitations:**
- Small static arrays (3-10 items) flagged for missing useMemo
- Object creation in `.map()` transformations flagged as performance issue
- Empty dependency arrays in `useEffect` (intentional mount-only pattern) flagged as stale closures

---

### 3. Next.js Detector

**Issues Detected:** 230 across all projects
**Precision:** 35% (81 actionable / 230 total)

**Detection Categories:**

| Category | Count | Precision | Status |
|----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Image Optimization | 20 | 80% | High value |
| Server Components | 20 | 75% | Good suggestions |
| Metadata & SEO | 40 | 40% | Context needed |
| Caching Configuration | 90 | 10% | Low signal |
| Error Boundaries | 60 | 20% | Low signal |

**Strengths:**
- Accurately identifies `<img>` tags that should use Next.js Image component
- Detects client components that could be server components
- Catches missing SEO metadata on standalone pages

**Known Limitations:**
- Suggests `error.tsx` files even when parent layouts provide error boundaries
- Flags pages without explicit cache config (Next.js defaults are often appropriate)
- Doesn't check parent layout hierarchy for inherited metadata

---

### 4. Import Detector

**Issues Detected:** 1,285 across all projects
**Precision:** 7% (85 actionable / 1,285 total)

**Detection Categories:**

| Category | Count | Precision | Status |
|----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Unused Imports | 85 | 95% | Excellent |
| Import Organization | 1,200 | 5% | Style preference |

**Strengths:**
- Very accurate detection of genuinely unused imports
- Safe auto-fix capability for removing dead imports

**Known Limitations:**
- Import sorting/organization checks are stylistic, not correctness issues
- Currently represents 93% of all import detector output
- Type imports used in JSDoc comments occasionally flagged as unused

---

### 5. Consistency Detector

**Issues Detected:** 247 across all projects
**Precision:** 6% (15 actionable / 247 total)

**Detection Categories:**

| Category | Count | Precision | Status |
|----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Async Patterns | 8 | 50% | Mixed |
| Export Patterns | 10 | 20% | Style |
| Import Consistency | 30 | 10% | Style |
| Magic Numbers | 1,200+ flagged | 5% | High noise |

**Known Limitations:**
- SVG coordinate values flagged as "magic numbers" (not extractable to constants)
- CSS-in-JS numeric values and Tailwind classes flagged
- Relative vs absolute import mixing is stylistic, not a quality issue

---

## Overall Precision Metrics

| Consistency Detector | 15 (6%) | 25 (10%) | 207 (84%) | 247 | 6% |
| **OVERALL** | **1,201 (27%)** | **1,400 (31%)** | **1,904 (42%)** | **4,505** | **28.4%** |

**Definitions:**
- **True Positive:** Actionable issues that improve code quality, performance, or correctness
- **False Positive:** Incorrect flags where code is actually fine
- **Noise:** Technically correct but low-value findings (style preferences, micro-optimizations)
- **Precision:** Percentage of flagged issues that are worth addressing

## Known Limitations & Roadmap

### Current Limitations

**Import Organization Noise (93% of import issues)**
- Import sorting checks are stylistic, not quality issues
- Many teams prefer logical grouping over alphabetical
- **Target:** Make configurable or remove from default checks

**Magic Number Detection in Visual Code (84% of consistency issues)**
- SVG coordinates and CSS values flagged inappropriately
- Not extractable to constants in most cases
- **Target:** Exclude SVG files and styling contexts

**Next.js Framework Awareness**
- Special exports (`metadata`, `generateStaticParams`) flagged as dead code
- Error boundaries inherited from layouts not recognized
- **Target:** Add Next.js framework pattern whitelist

**Context-Blind Performance Suggestions**
- Small arrays (< 10 items) suggested for useMemo
- `.map()` operations flagged same as hot loops
- **Target:** Size-aware and context-aware detection

### Improvement Roadmap

**Version 1.1 - Noise Reduction (Target Precision: 66%)**
- Make import sorting optional/configurable
- Exclude SVG and CSS-in-JS from magic number detection
- Whitelist Next.js framework exports
- Context-aware error handling checks

**Version 1.2 - Framework Intelligence**
- Parent layout hierarchy checking (metadata, error boundaries)
- Smart cache config suggestions
- Data size awareness for performance checks

**Version 1.3 - Advanced Analysis**
- JSDoc type reference parsing
- Hot path detection for performance checks
- Component export pattern recognition

**Expected Impact:** Implementing Version 1.1 improvements would reduce total issues by ~60% while increasing precision from 28% to 66%.
