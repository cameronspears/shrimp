# Shrimp: Best-in-Class Product Roadmap

> **Goal:** Make Shrimp the invisible infrastructure that Claude Code users can't live without - like spellcheck for code.

## Core Philosophy

**Spellcheck doesn't ask permission. It just works.**

Shrimp should:
- Run automatically without being called
- Fix issues invisibly in the background
- Show value constantly through real-time feedback
- Learn project patterns and adapt
- Never get in your way

---

## Phase 1: Proactive Monitoring (Weeks 1-2)

### The Problem
Right now, Shrimp is reactive - users (or Claude Code) have to explicitly call it. That's not how spellcheck works.

### The Solution: Real-Time Background Monitoring

**1.1 File Watcher Mode**

```bash
shrimp watch
```

Starts a background process that:
- Watches all source files for changes
- Runs lightweight checks on save (< 50ms)
- Accumulates issues in memory
- Exposes status via MCP tool `shrimp_status`

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// New MCP tool: shrimp_watch_start
// Starts file watcher in background
// Returns: watcher_id

// Claude Code can start this automatically when opening a project
```

**Key Features:**
- **Incremental checks:** Only analyze changed files
- **Smart debouncing:** Wait 500ms after last change before checking
- **Memory efficient:** Keep last 1000 issues max
- **Health score caching:** Update score incrementally

**User Experience:**
- Claude Code starts watcher automatically on project open
- Status bar shows: "Health: 89/100 ↑2" (always visible)
- Claude Code knows health status without asking
- Can proactively suggest fixes during conversation

---

**1.2 Claude Code Status Bar Integration**

Add to Claude Code's status line:
```
🦐 89/100 ↑2
```

Clicking shows:
```
Shrimp Health: 89/100
- 3 import issues
- 2 performance warnings
- 1 accessibility issue

[Auto-fix] [Details]
```

**Technical Approach:**
- MCP tool: `shrimp_get_live_status` (pulls from watcher)
- Updates every 5 seconds
- Shows trend (↑ improving, ↓ declining, → stable)
- Color-coded: 90+ green, 80-89 yellow, <80 red

---

**1.3 Proactive Claude Code Suggestions**

When Claude Code is making changes, Shrimp can interject:

**Scenario 1: Before refactoring**
```
You: "Refactor the auth module"

Claude Code:
*[Checks shrimp_status]*
"I see the auth module currently has health 75/100 with 5
unused imports and 2 empty catch blocks. I'll fix those as
part of the refactor."
```

**Scenario 2: After making changes**
```
Claude Code:
*[Watches shrimp_status change from 87 → 84]*
"Wait - my changes dropped health by 3 points. Let me check
what happened... I introduced 2 inline objects in render.
Let me fix those."
```

**Scenario 3: Commit-time check**
```
You: "Commit these changes"

Claude Code:
*[Checks shrimp_status]*
"Hold on - health dropped from 89 → 82. We should fix these
issues before committing:
- 2 new unused imports
- 1 missing alt text
Want me to fix these first?"
```

**Implementation:**
- Claude Code checks `shrimp_status` before/after major operations
- Compares health scores
- Suggests fixes proactively
- Can auto-fix without asking (if configured)

---

## Phase 2: Intelligent Auto-Fixing (Weeks 2-4)

### The Problem
Auto-fixing is risky. Users don't trust tools that change their code without understanding it.

### The Solution: Confidence-Scored, Gradual Auto-Fixing

**2.1 Fix Confidence Scoring**

Every fix gets a confidence score:

**99% - Always safe (auto-fix without asking):**
- Remove unused imports that are definitely unused
- Remove console.log/debugger statements
- Fix trailing whitespace
- Add missing semicolons (if project uses them)

**90-98% - Safe with review (show notification):**
- Add alt text (inferred from context)
- Add aria-labels (generated from nearby text)
- Fix empty catch blocks (add comment)
- Organize imports

**80-89% - Needs confirmation (ask first):**
- Extract inline objects to useMemo
- Refactor complex functions
- Update outdated patterns

**<80% - Manual only (flag for human review):**
- Architectural changes
- Logic modifications
- API changes

**Implementation:**
```typescript
interface Fix {
  type: string;
  confidence: number;
  description: string;
  diff: string;
  canRevert: boolean;
}

// MCP tool: shrimp_fix_with_confidence
// Returns array of Fix objects with scores
// Claude Code decides which to apply based on confidence
```

---

**2.2 Learning Mode**

**First Week with Shrimp:**
```
Shrimp is learning your project patterns...

So far, I've:
- Observed 23 commits
- Learned your import organization style
- Noticed you prefer async/await over .then()
- Detected you use Prettier for formatting

I could have fixed 47 issues automatically.
Ready to enable auto-fix? [Yes] [Not yet]
```

**After Learning:**
- Shrimp auto-fixes high-confidence issues
- Shows notification: "Auto-fixed 3 issues while you worked"
- Learns which fixes you keep vs revert
- Adjusts confidence scores based on your behavior

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Track user behavior
interface ProjectLearning {
  commitsAnalyzed: number;
  fixesAccepted: Record<string, number>;
  fixesReverted: Record<string, number>;
  codingPatterns: {
    importStyle: 'grouped' | 'alphabetical' | 'none';
    errorHandling: 'try-catch' | 'callback' | 'mixed';
    asyncStyle: 'async-await' | 'promises' | 'mixed';
  };
}

// Adjust confidence based on acceptance rate
// If user always reverts "add-alt-text", lower its confidence
```

---

**2.3 Undo Stack**

Every auto-fix is reversible:

```bash
shrimp undo           # Undo last fix
shrimp undo --all     # Undo all fixes from last session
shrimp history        # Show fix history
```

**In Claude Code:**
```
Status bar: "🦐 Auto-fixed 3 issues"
Click to expand:
  [Undo all] [Details]

Details:
  ✓ Removed unused import 'useState' in Auth.tsx
  ✓ Added alt text to image in Hero.tsx
  ✓ Fixed empty catch in api/users.ts
```

**Implementation:**
- Every fix creates a git stash entry
- Store fix metadata in `.shrimp/history.json`
- Can restore from stash by fix ID
- Automatic cleanup after 30 days

---

**2.4 Auto-Fix on Commit (Git Hook)**

```bash
shrimp install-hooks --auto-fix
```

Creates pre-commit hook:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Run Shrimp check
shrimp check --auto-fix --confidence 95

# If health dropped significantly, block commit
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ Shrimp: Health check failed"
  echo "Run 'shrimp check' to see issues"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Shrimp: Auto-fixed 3 issues, health maintained"
```

**Behavior:**
1. Check health before commit
2. Auto-fix issues with confidence ≥95%
3. If health still drops >5 points, block commit
4. Show clear message about what was fixed
5. Can bypass with `SHRIMP_SKIP=1 git commit`

---

## Phase 3: Real-Time Feedback (Weeks 4-6)

### The Problem
Users don't see Shrimp's value until they explicitly run it. Spellcheck shows red squiggles immediately.

### The Solution: Live Health Indicators

**3.1 File-Level Health Scores**

```typescript
// New MCP tool: shrimp_file_health
// Returns health score for specific file

{
  "file": "src/components/Auth.tsx",
  "health": 78,
  "issues": [
    { "line": 45, "type": "unused-import", "severity": "warning" },
    { "line": 89, "type": "empty-catch", "severity": "error" }
  ],
  "canAutoFix": 2,
  "requiresManual": 0
}
```

**Claude Code Usage:**
When user opens a file, Claude Code can:
- Check `shrimp_file_health` in background
- Show issues in problems panel
- Highlight problematic lines
- Offer "Auto-fix all" quick action

---

**3.2 Real-Time Health Updates During Edits**

**Scenario: User is editing Auth.tsx**

```
Initial state: Health 89/100

User adds:
  import { useState } from 'react'

Shrimp watcher detects:
  Health → 89/100 (no change, import is used)

User adds:
  import { useEffect } from 'react'

Shrimp watcher detects:
  Health → 88/100 (useEffect unused)

Status bar updates: 🦐 88/100 ↓1

Claude Code (proactively):
"I notice you imported useEffect but haven't used it yet.
Want me to remove it?"
```

**Implementation:**
- Watcher runs check on every file save
- Compares with previous health score
- If score drops, notify Claude Code
- Claude Code can decide to interject or stay quiet

---

**3.3 Commit Health Diff**

```bash
git commit
```

**Shrimp pre-commit hook shows:**
```

## Phase 5: Learning & Adaptation (Ongoing)

### The Problem
Every project is different. One-size-fits-all rules don't work.

### The Solution: Project-Specific Learning

**5.1 Pattern Detection**

Shrimp learns from your codebase:

```typescript
// After analyzing 100+ files, Shrimp detects:

{
  "patterns": {
    "errorHandling": {
      "style": "async-await",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "examples": 47
    },
    "importOrganization": {
      "style": "grouped-by-type",
      "groups": ["react", "external", "internal", "relative"],
      "confidence": 0.92
    },
    "namingConventions": {
      "components": "PascalCase",
      "hooks": "use-camelCase",
      "utils": "camelCase"
    },
    "testPatterns": {
      "location": "colocated",
      "naming": "*.test.ts"
    }
  }
}
```

**Uses learning to:**
- Adjust fix recommendations
- Customize auto-fix behavior
- Reduce false positives
- Understand project-specific patterns

---

**5.2 False Positive Feedback**

When Shrimp flags something incorrectly:

```bash
shrimp ignore <issue-id> --reason "This is intentional"
```

**Or in Claude Code:**
```
Claude Code: "Shrimp found an empty catch block at auth.ts:45"
You: "That's intentional, the error is handled upstream"
Claude Code: *[Calls shrimp_ignore with reason]*
```

**Shrimp learns:**
- Never flag this specific pattern again
- Reduces confidence for similar patterns
- Shares learning with team (if enabled)

---

**5.3 Custom Rules**

```javascript
// .shrimp/rules.js

export default {
  rules: {
    'custom/no-fetch-in-components': {
      message: 'Use our useApi hook instead of fetch',
      pattern: /fetch\s*\(/,
      filePattern: /components\/.*\.tsx$/,
      severity: 'error',
      autofix: false
    },
    'custom/require-error-boundary': {
      message: 'Async components need error boundaries',
      check: (ast) => {
        // Custom AST analysis
      },
      severity: 'warning'
    }
  }
}
```

**Team-specific rules enforced automatically.**

---

## Phase 6: The "Wow" Moments (Launch Features)

### Features that make users go "I can't believe this is possible"

**6.1 Time Travel Health**

```bash
shrimp health --history
```

Shows health over time:
```
Health History (Last 30 Days)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

90 ┤                          ╭──  Current: 89
85 ┤              ╭───────────╯
80 ┤     ╭────────╯
75 ┤─────╯
   └─────────────────────────────
   Oct 1              Oct 30

🎯 Milestones:
  Oct 5:  Passed 80 for first time
  Oct 15: Added WCAG checks (+5 points)
  Oct 28: Best score ever (92)

💡 Insights:
  - Average +0.5 points/day
  - Most improved: accessibility (+15)
  - Still needs work: performance (-2)
```

**Claude Code can reference this:**
> "Your health has been steadily improving! You're up 14 points since Oct 1. Keep it up!"

---

**6.2 Health Predictions**

```bash
shrimp predict
```

**AI-powered forecast:**
```
🔮 Health Forecast (Next 30 Days)

Based on your current trajectory:
  Expected health: 92/100 (+3)

Predictions:
  ✅ You'll fix remaining import issues (85% confident)
  ⚠️ Performance score may drop if current patterns continue
  ✅ Accessibility on track to reach 100%

📊 If you maintain current pace:
  - Hit 90+ health: 12 days
  - Reach 95 target: 28 days

💡 To accelerate:
  1. Focus on performance (biggest opportunity)
  2. Refactor 3 complex functions
  3. Set up automated import cleanup
```

---

**6.3 AI-Powered Fix Explanations**

When Shrimp fixes something, it explains why:

```
🦐 Auto-fixed: Removed unused import 'useEffect'

Why this matters:
  Unused imports increase bundle size and slow compilation.
  In your case, this saved ~2KB in the final bundle.

How Shrimp knew:
  ✓ Static analysis confirmed no references
  ✓ Checked dynamic imports too
  ✓ Verified not used in JSX or as type

This is safe because:
  • Import has no side effects
  • Not re-exported from this file
  • Can easily be re-added if needed

## The "Can't Live Without It" Test

After 30 days, if we ask users to uninstall Shrimp, they should say:

❌ "Wait, what? No, I need that."
✅ "Are you kidding? It saves me hours every week."
✅ "My code is so much cleaner now, I don't want to go back."
✅ "It just works in the background, I barely think about it."
✅ "Our whole team uses it, we'd have to change our workflow."

**That's when we know we've succeeded.**

### Data Flow

**1. File changes:**
```
File saved → Watcher detects → Queue check → Run detectors →
Update health score → Notify MCP server → Claude Code status bar updates
```

**2. Claude Code interaction:**
```
User request → Claude Code checks shrimp_status →
Sees health score → Decides if intervention needed →
Calls shrimp_fix if appropriate → Shows results to user
```

**3. Auto-fix:**
```
Issue detected → Check confidence score → If >95%, apply fix →
Store in undo stack → Update health → Notify user →
Track acceptance/revert → Adjust future confidence
```

## Launch Strategy

### Week 1-2: Private Beta
- Invite 50 Claude Code power users
- Focus on feedback and bugs
- Iterate on auto-fix confidence
- Build initial case studies

**Goal:** Prove the concept works

### Week 3: Launch

**1. Show HN:**
```
Title: Shrimp – Code health monitoring that works inside Claude Code

Hey HN! I built Shrimp because I was frustrated by code quality
tools that interrupt my flow. Shrimp runs in the background and
auto-fixes issues as you code - like spellcheck for code.

The coolest part: it integrates with Claude Code via MCP, so
Claude can proactively fix issues during refactoring conversations.

Try it: npm install -g @shrimphealth/cli
Or add the MCP server: claude mcp add shrimp-health ...

Would love your feedback!
```

**2. Social media blitz:**
- Twitter thread with demo video
- Reddit: r/programming, r/claude, r/typescript
- Dev.to article: "I made code health monitoring invisible"
- YouTube demo: "How Shrimp keeps your code healthy automatically"

**3. Outreach:**
- Email Claude team about MCP server
- Submit to MCP server directory
- Reach out to dev tool reviewers
- Post in Claude Code community

### Week 4-8: Growth
