# Shrimp Health - Testing & Continuous Improvement System

A comprehensive testing framework for continuously improving detection accuracy and preventing regressions.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run all tests
bun test

# Generate detection quality report
bun test:report

# Track quality trends over time
bun test:track
```

## What Was Built

### 1. Unit Test Suite
**Location:** `tests/unit/bug-detector.test.ts`

Comprehensive unit tests covering:
- React Hooks detection (conditional hooks, missing deps)
- Async/Await issues (error handling, floating promises)
- Security issues (SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets)
- Type safety (excessive `any`, non-null assertions)
- Logic errors (assignment in conditions, async forEach)
- Resource leaks (setInterval, addEventListener)
- React performance (inline objects/functions in JSX)

**Current Status:** 26/28 passing (2 intentional failures revealing real detector issues)

### 2. Integration Test Suite
**Location:** `tests/integration/real-world.test.ts`

Tests Shrimp against your gielinor-gains codebase (215 TypeScript files):
- **Detection Coverage:** Validates all files can be analyzed
- **Quality Metrics:** Tracks average issues per file (target: 2-5)
- **Severity Distribution:** Ensures healthy error/warning/info balance
- **Performance Benchmarks:** Validates analysis speed (< 50ms per file)
- **Baseline Tracking:** Monitors detection changes over time

**Current Results:**
```
Files Analyzed:    215
Total Issues:      841 (3.91 avg per file)
Performance:       0.30ms per file
Quality Score:     100/100

Severity:
  Errors:   117 (13.9%)
  Warnings: 372 (44.2%)
  Info:     352 (41.9%)

Top Categories:
  Logic Error:       393 (46.7%)
  Type Safety:       178 (21.2%)
  React Performance:  98 (11.7%)
```

### 3. Detection Quality Reports
**Command:** `bun test:report`
**Location:** `scripts/generate-test-report.ts`

Generates detailed reports showing:
- Overview statistics
- Severity distribution (with visualization)
- Category breakdown (with bar charts)
- Quality score (0-100)
- Actionable recommendations

### 4. Quality Trend Tracking
**Command:** `bun test:track`
**Location:** `scripts/track-quality-trend.ts`

Tracks detection quality over time:
- Records metrics after each test run
- Shows recent changes vs previous run
- Shows overall trend since first run
- Provides interpretation of trends
- Stores up to 100 historical data points

### 5. Baseline System
**Location:** `tests/baselines/`

Automatically maintains baseline data:
- `gielinor-gains-baseline.json` - Current detection state
- `quality-trends.json` - Historical quality metrics

Baselines are automatically created on first run and compared on subsequent runs.

## Testing Workflow

### Daily Development

```bash
# Make changes to detectors
vim src/detectors/bug-detector.ts

# Run unit tests to verify changes
bun test:unit

# Run integration tests to check for regressions
bun test:integration

# View quality report
bun test:report

# Track the change
bun test:track
```

### After User Reports False Positive

1. **Add test case:**
```typescript
it('should NOT flag valid pattern', async () => {
  const code = `/* code that was incorrectly flagged */`;
  const issues = await detector.analyze('test.ts', code);
  expect(issues).toHaveLength(0);
});
```

2. **Fix detector logic:**
```typescript
// Update detection logic in src/detectors/bug-detector.ts
```

3. **Verify fix:**
```bash
bun test:unit
bun test:integration
bun test:report
```

4. **Track impact:**
```bash
bun test:track
```

### Weekly Quality Review

```bash
# Run full test suite
bun test

# Generate comprehensive report
bun test:report

# Review quality trends
bun test:track

# Check baseline changes
cat tests/baselines/gielinor-gains-baseline.json
```

## Key Metrics to Monitor

### Detection Quality Score (0-100)
- **100**: Perfect balance
- **80-99**: Good
- **60-79**: Acceptable
- **<60**: Needs improvement

### Average Issues Per File
- **Target:** 2-5 issues per file
- **Too High (>6):** Detection may be too aggressive
- **Too Low (<1.5):** Detection may be too lenient

### Severity Distribution
- **Errors:** Should be < 30% of total
- **Warnings:** Bulk of issues (40-50%)
- **Info:** Style/minor issues (30-40%)

### Performance
- **Target:** < 50ms per file
- **Current:** 0.30ms per file (excellent!)

## Understanding Test Results

### Unit Tests
Pass/fail for specific detection patterns. Failures indicate:
- Detector logic needs adjustment
- Test expectations may be wrong
- Edge case not handled

### Integration Tests
Validates real-world performance. Common issues:
- **Too many issues found:** Detection too aggressive
- **Too few issues found:** Missing real problems
- **Performance slow:** Need optimization
- **Baseline divergence:** Recent changes impacted detection

### Quality Reports
Shows detection health:
- High error rate → Too aggressive
- Low issue count → Missing problems
- Unbalanced categories → Over-detecting specific patterns

### Trend Tracking
Shows improvement over time:
- **Quality score increasing:** Good!
- **Issue count decreasing:** Fixing false positives or real issues
- **Issue count increasing:** Adding new detections or false positives

## Advanced Usage

### Testing Against Multiple Codebases

Add more integration test files:

```typescript
// tests/integration/another-project.test.ts
const PROJECT_PATH = path.resolve(__dirname, '../../../another-project');
const BASELINE_PATH = path.join(__dirname, '../baselines/another-project-baseline.json');
```

### Customizing Quality Metrics

Edit `scripts/generate-test-report.ts` to adjust:
- Quality score calculation
- Acceptable ranges
- Report format

### Adding New Detectors

1. Create detector in `src/detectors/`
2. Add unit tests in `tests/unit/`
3. Run integration tests to establish baseline
4. Track quality impact with `bun test:track`

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Failing After Changes
1. Check if failures are expected (fixing false positives)
2. Verify detector logic is correct
3. Update test expectations if needed
4. Re-run integration tests

### Baseline Mismatch
```bash
# If changes are intentional, regenerate baseline
rm tests/baselines/gielinor-gains-baseline.json
bun test:integration
```

### Performance Degradation
1. Profile slow detector
2. Optimize regex patterns
3. Reduce string operations
4. Add caching if needed

## Next Steps

1. **Add More Unit Tests:** Cover edge cases as you find them
2. **Test Against More Projects:** Add other real codebases
3. **Track Precision/Recall:** Manually validate samples to measure accuracy
4. **Automate CI:** Run tests on every commit
5. **User Feedback Loop:** Collect false positive reports systematically
